Step 1: Downloaded dataset

Step 2: Read the data and check for irregularities

Step 3: Performed data preprocessing, encoded/transformed data to prep for modelling

Step 4: Applied classifier models with prep'ed dataset, models used are:

    a. Logistic Regression
    b. Random Forest
    c. Linear Support Vector

Step 5: Observed prediction accuracy were a little on the low side, predicted test parameters to observe results

Step 6: Applied feature selection by checking correlation of features in dataset to try and boost accuracy

Step 7: Re-applied classifier models with new selected features

Step 7: Concluded with higher prediction accuracy and results from predicting test parameters
